# VIRTUE — 3D Browser FPS PVP

## Original Problem Statement
Build a fully functional basic shooter PVP game with online servers.
- Perspective: Simple 3D first-person shooter.
- Players: Account-based with login.
- Multiplayer: Free-for-all deathmatch.
- Map: Single arena with obstacles.
- Visual: Comic art style (Marvel Rivals).
- Added requirements: Ranked mode, custom weapons (AK-47, Katana, Laser Gun), procedural audio, AI opponents, ranked matchmaking queue.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + Three.js (`/app/frontend`), Tailwind, Shadcn UI. Engine in `/app/frontend/src/game/engine.js`, WebSocket client in `network.js`, procedural Web Audio in `audio.js`. HUD overlay in `components/Hud.jsx`.
- **Backend**: FastAPI + WebSockets + MongoDB (`/app/backend/server.py`, monolithic). 20Hz server-authoritative tick. Two rooms: `casual` and `ranked`. Server-side raycast hit detection, AI bots, leaderboards, MMR-based queue.
- **Auth**: JWT (HS256), refresh cookies, admin seed.

## Completed (chronological)
### Initial MVP
- 3D Three.js arena, FastAPI WebSocket multiplayer, MongoDB user model.
- Auth (register/login), profile, leaderboards (casual + ranked).
- Procedural Web Audio (gunshots, hits, footsteps, lobby rock music).
- Comic-style HUD, click-to-play overlay, scoreboard, death overlay, match-end overlay.

### Iteration 2 (prev session)
- Ranked queue (>= 2 same-tier real players), tracers, katana melee, tiers modal, weaker bots, AK-47 model.

### Iteration 3 (prev session)
- One-shot katana, forced ranked queue (same-rank matching), ADS (right-click), map roads/buildings, easier bots, death animation, Laser Gun (key 3), removed "browser fps" text.

### Iteration 4 — **THIS SESSION (2026-02-20)**
- ✅ **Kill-marker icons in kill feed** — weapon icons (AK-47/Katana/Laser) replace generic skull. Backend kill events now carry a `weapon` field; HUD renders color-coded icons. (server.py + Hud.jsx + Game.jsx)
- ✅ **Non-blocking queue toast** — converted the full-screen ranked queue modal into a small bottom-right toast. Players can navigate the lobby (Play, Profile, Leaderboard) while queue polls; ranked button disabled + "IN QUEUE..." indicator. (Lobby.jsx)
- ✅ **Placement match streak** — first 5 ranked matches give 2× RP gains, with losses softened to 0. New `placement_matches_played` counter, surfaced via `in_placements`, `placement_matches_played`, `placement_matches_total` on the user object, and a "PLACEMENTS X/5 · 2x RP" badge in the lobby. Match-end overlay shows a P#/5 star badge and "2x" suffix on positive deltas. (server.py constants + end_match + public_user + Lobby + Hud)

### Iteration 6 — **THIS SESSION (2026-02-22, late)**
- ✅ **Match History on Profile** — New `match_history` collection (indexed `(user_id, ended_at desc)`). Backend writes a row per real player on `end_match` with `mode`, `kills`, `deaths`, `placement`, `total_players`, `rp_delta`, `rank_points_after`, `is_placement`, `ended_at`. New `GET /api/profile/me/history?limit=10` endpoint returns newest-first. Profile page now renders a "Match History · Last 10" card with mode badge, placement, K/D, ΔRP and rank chip; empty/loading/error states all wired up.
- ✅ **Offline-vs-AI mode** — New `mode=offline` on the WS endpoint creates a per-user private room (`OFFLINE_ROOMS` dict) with 3 combat bots (suffix `-O`). Room is destroyed when the last real player disconnects. New "OFFLINE VS AI" green button in Lobby (`lobby-offline-button` testid). Tested: room spawns + destroys cleanly via logs.
- ✅ **Mobile lobby final-fit** — Tightened spacing so the lobby now scrolls = 700 on 390×700 viewport even with the 6th OFFLINE button added (was 710 → 700). All 6 main action buttons visible without scroll.
- ✅ **Full regression** — testing_agent_v3_fork: 18/18 backend tests (100%), 10/11 frontend (only TAB-on-PC Playwright limitation). 0 critical / 0 minor / 0 ui-bug findings. (See `/app/test_reports/iteration_3.json`.)

### Iteration 5 — 2026-02-22
- ✅ **Mobile-fit login & lobby** — Login and Lobby now use `min-h-[100dvh]` and selectively hide non-essential UI on small screens so the 5 main action buttons (Quick Match, Ranked, Practice, Leaderboard, Profile) all fit a 390×700 viewport without scrolling. Hidden on mobile: music/SFX toggles, install button, "Show Tiers", "Free-For-All · Online" pill, active-players row, stats grid, Controls + Sensitivity bottom cards. PC layout unchanged. Placement badge compacts to "P 0/5 · 2x" on mobile.
- ✅ **Hide Google sign-in on tiny screens** — Added `short` Tailwind breakpoint (`max-height: 700px`) and applied `short:hidden` to the Google OAuth button + "OR" divider on Login so login form fits a tiny viewport without scroll.
- ✅ **Platform icon on scoreboard** — Each player now carries a `platform` field on the `Player` state and `to_state()` payload. Client detects touch/gamepad/pc and sends a `set_platform` WS message after connect. Hud scoreboard renders a Smartphone, Gamepad2 or Monitor icon next to each player's name (BOT badge unchanged for bots). 3 new pytest cases pass.
- ✅ **Mobile scoreboard button** — Added a top-center "SCORE" press-and-hold button on touch devices (`touch-scoreboard` testid). Hold to view scoreboard, release to hide. Wired via new `onToggleScoreboard` prop on TouchControls.
- ✅ **Queue timer restored (no labels)** — Both Quick Match and Ranked queue toasts again show a big numeric timer (Quick: countdown from 10; Ranked: elapsed MM:SS) but without "Filling with bots in" / "Wait time" / "Starting in" labels.
- ✅ **Removed Quick Match queue header text** — The toast no longer shows "Quick Match — Searching"; just the spinner, cancel button, and countdown number.
- ✅ **Goonmaster real-vs-real only** — `bot_fill_seconds_for_tier(7) = ∞`; matchmaker skips bot-fill for tier 7. API returns `bot_fill_seconds: -1` for Goonmaster so the client can recognize "never bot-fills".

Tested: 8/8 new backend pytest cases pass (`/app/backend/tests/test_placement_weapons_queue.py`), frontend verified end-to-end via screenshot tool (placement badge, queue toast, disabled ranked button, kill-feed weapon icons rendering).

## Known Pre-existing Issues (not regressions)
- `test_shooter_backend.py::TestHealth::test_root_health` expects deprecated `players_online` key (current schema returns `casual_players`/`ranked_players`).
- `TestLeaderboardAndProfile::test_leaderboard_sorted_desc` expects kills-desc; current sort is rank_points desc.
- `TestWebSocket::test_two_clients_see_each_other_shoot_kill_persists` and `TestBotsActivelyShoot` flaky (timing-dependent on bot AI).

## Roadmap / Backlog
### P1
- Live spectator camera for queued players (watch ongoing matches while waiting).
- Loadout selection in lobby (pick primary weapon before spawn).

### P2
- Bot difficulty modes (Recruit / Veteran / Apex).
- Match history page (last 10 matches with placements, kills, RP delta).
- Daily challenges / per-weapon mastery XP.

### P3
- Custom rooms / private lobbies with invite codes.
- Cosmetics (skins, kill cards).
- Region selection / multi-server.

## Tech Notes
- Hit detection: server-side raycast vs 3-sphere capsule hitboxes.
- 20Hz tick, client predicts movement, server reconciles.
- Bots: simulated WS connections inside the backend, casual room only by default.
- Ranked: `RANKED_MIN_REAL_PLAYERS=1` currently (solo-queue routed to bots after `QUEUE_BOT_FILL_SEC=30s`).
- Placement constants: `PLACEMENT_MATCHES=5`, `PLACEMENT_MULTIPLIER=2` in server.py.
